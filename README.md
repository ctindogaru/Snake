# Snake

To run the game you need to install the curses library. For linux users:  
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

To play: make -> make run -> choose the game mode -> have fun and watch your tail :).

If the snake will eat a piece of food it will grow with one unit.  
For every 2 units his speed will increase.  
The game will end if the snake bites himself.
